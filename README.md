# Reverse-temperature-algorithm

## The purpose of this algorithm

The purpose of this algorithm is to calculate hypotethical Fo91 crystallisation temperatures for olivines under Fo91 with the method detailed in (MATTHEWS, S., WONG, K., SHORTTLE, O., EDMONDS, M. & MACLENNAN, J. 2021. Do olivine crystallization temperatures faithfully record mantle temperature variability? Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 22, e2020GC009157.). Slight variations were made compared to the calculations presented by Matthews and the principles in the calculations are given in detail at:

## How to use

There is a demo named `Fo91_extrapolation_demo.R` in the repository. It uses the `cat_olivine_demo.csv` file and calculates the Fo91 crystallisation temperature for a single sample. You can use this demo as a guideline as how this algorithm works.
